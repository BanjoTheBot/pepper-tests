# Resource

Different non-code files used by the robot or for testing, this includes images and audio files.
This folder is kept in the repo, but audio files aren't uploaded, so some code won't work until you supply a file yourself.

DO NOT MODIFY FILES IN /ug/

Files in /ug/ (standing for user generated) are files generated when running certain robot files, eg; the recording made by repeat.py.
They are dynamic and not to be touched
