# pepper-tests

Individual Python scripts used to test Pepper robot before starting larger projects.

Written in Python 2.7 because this API is OLD

Choregraphe and stuff is confusing me and just not working and/or doing random shit, so this is gonna be painful :)

These scripts work independently of it, but this is still a lot to learn and take in
